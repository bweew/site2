my mom ordered a bunch of crap online that came wrapped in packing peanuts.
empty boxes filled with air taking up the entire garage. 
it pisses me off that they still make these out of polystyrene. 
it can't go in a landfill, it blows around, ends up in the ocean or in a birds stomach, and my mom doesnt't care, she keeps ordering more.
theres no room to park my bike.

	you have to drive to the dump and pay to get them removed. 
	they static cling to you if you try to sweep them up.
	they're ugly and will clog your sink if you try to wash them off.

	<h2> the solution</h2>
	<p style="
	font-family:serif;">
	melt them with acetone.
they disolve down to nothing.
I scored a bottle of nail polish remover from the dollar store for 2$.
I used an empty alfredo sauce  jar to store it.
It has the consistency of mozarella.

		I was able to re use some of the cut up cardboard the packing peanuts came in to make a back board for some art projects.
		the firmness of the cardboard lets me hold my pictures up so they don't flop around.
		elevating my boring printed sheets that would normally get lost in a pile, into self standing objects.
