	Mama ordered an abundance of crap online, which  contained in packing
	peanuts. The entirety of the garage was taken up with empty boxes filled
	with air. It discomforts me that these remain composed of polystyrene. It
	can't be thrown away; it drifts around, ends up in the ocean, or in the
	stomach of a bird, and mama doesn't care; she continues ordering more. There
	is no place for my bike.

	You have to travel to the landfill and pay to get them deleted. If you endeavour to sweep them up, they are going to adhere to you statically.They're disgusting and if you try to sanitise them away, they'll clog your washbasin.

	<h2> The solution</h2>
	<p style="
	font-family:serif;">
Melt them in acetone.
They disintegrate into nothingness.
I acquired a bottle of nail polish eliminator for two bucks from the dollar retailer. 
I archived it in a used vacant alfredo.
It possesses the consistency of mozarella.

		I was able to repurpose some of the hacked up cardboard that was included with the shipping peanuts to fabricate a backing to use in imaginative endeavours. The rigidity empowers me to securely prop up the graphics so they refrain from bouncing elsewhere. raising my mundane printed materials that traditionally vanish in an accumulation, into self autonomous entities.
