 <p> lessons go here.
the table of contents is auto generated by javascript based on the id tags of each section. set a fixed height on the toc to keep it up at the top for easy navigation. 
also im using HSL colors in the css for this for the first time instead of naming colors or using rgb because its easier to come up with quick color pallates that are complimentary to eachother.

 <h2 id="block-chord-harmony">block chord harmony </h2>
<p>
	c6 and ddim. harmonize the major scale by alternating between the inversions. also works for minor if you flatten the 3. this is the barry harris thing. the interesting part about this is 4 other keys share the same d dim.
	eb, f#, a. notice how these are notes of c diminished. there is a strong 1 5 pull with this kind of harmony. normal major harmony goes from completly resolved at 1 and moves towards the peak tension at 5 before coming back home, while with diminished theory the 2 is already max tension. this is because every diminished chord can be thought of as a rootless 5 chord relating to its other keys(a 7b9).

<blockquote>
	am6 > e7b9
	cm6 > g7b9
	ebm6 > bb7b9
	f#m6 > b7b9
</blockquote>

<p>
	one dim shape is good for 8 keys. 4 major and 4 minor. this makes it worthwhile to commit it to muscle memory. becauae its shape is symetrical its also a little bit easier to visualize its placement on your insturment compared to other chord shapes.
</p>
	
<p>
	because there are only 3 diminished chords for all 12 keys and the rest are just inversions of themselves. by process of elimination if you just learn 1/3 you already narrow down majority of the notes you know to avoid or  can lean into. this lets you develop your intuition as you improvise as you can hear what sounds out and make more connections.
