SUMMARY:Jam at the Lake
DESCRIPTION:Last night, while practicing, somebody came up and told me I was great. They gave me a toonie and asked if I had a Bandcamp and a business card, and I did!\n\nIt doesn't have to be tomorrow; I just wanted to say that this happened yesterday. It's super rare, but when it does happen, it's really encouraging to go outside and be around people.
