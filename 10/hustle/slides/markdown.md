## Hustle and Grind - Alberta Bruce



## I've been on my hustle



## I've been on my grind  



## I've been writing songs  



## Just to pass the time  



## If you are complainin'  



## You won't hear what I play well  



## Just sit down and listen  



## While I say what I say  



## What goes around comes around, son  



## What goes around comes around



## What goes around comes around, son  



## What goes around comes around



  
## Cuz I've been on my hustle  



## I've been on my grind  



## I've been writing songs  



## Just to pass the time  



## If you are complainin'  



## You won't hear what I say  



## Just sit down and listen  



## While I say what I say  



## What goes around comes around, son  



## What goes around comes around



## What goes around comes around, son  



## What goes around comes around



## Cuz I've been on my hustle  



## I've been on my grind  



## I've been pickin' grapes  



## Just to make a dime  



## If you are complainin'  



## You won't hear what I play  



## Just sit down and listen  



## While I say what I say  



## What goes around comes around, son  



## What goes around comes around



## What goes around comes around, son  



## What goes around comes around



## Cuz I've been on my hustle  



## I've been on my grind  



##  I've been pickin' grapes  



##  Just to make a dime  



##  If you are complainin'  



##  You won't hear what I play  



##  Just sit down and listen  



##  While I say what I say  



##  Ooooooooooooooooooooooooo
