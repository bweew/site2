			bitwise operators
		</h1>
		<p>
In zeroes and ones, the code doth reside
And bitwise operators, the tools we use
To manipulate each bit and byte with pride
And make our programs run without excuse

With AND, we set to zero unwanted bits
While OR lets us combine them as we please
XOR flips the switch, the logic never quits
And NOT turns ones to zeroes with great ease

The shift operators move bits left or right
Multiplying or dividing by powers of two
A useful tool in many a coding fight
To make our programs faster and more true

Oh, bitwise operators, how we adore
Thy power to transform and so much more.

	concatenate		
		</h1>
		<p>
	Oh, Linux cat, your simple command line grace
Makes text files dance and sing with effortless ease
In bytes and bits, you weave a spell so chaste
That even novices find their worries appeased

With just a flick of keystrokes on the screen
You summon words from darkness into light
No flashy GUI, no bells, no whistles keen
Yet all who use you find their hearts alight

You are the feline of the digital realm
A trusty friend, a helper always near
Your purrs and meows, a soothing audio helm
For those who navigate the tech frontier

Oh, Linux cat, how much we owe to thee
For making plain text files a joy to see.

		<h1>
			static types
		</h1>
		<p>
Amidst the code that flows like poetry,
A choice is made to bind or let flow free,
To define or not, to reign in or set loose,
The type that guides each variable's use.

Static types, like form and meter in verse,
Give structure, clarity, and aid reverse,
Errors caught before they can wreak havoc,
Code runs smoothly, no need to panic.

But some may argue, let dynamism reign,
Let freedom ring, let chaos have domain,
For creativity needs room to grow,
And rigid rules may stifle its flow.

So let us weigh the pros and cons, decide,
Which type of typing we shall abide,
For each has strengths and weaknesses to bear,
And in our code, they both have a share.

		<h1>
		web crawler	
		</h1>
		<p>
Amidst the endless expanse of the web,
Where information abounds in great measure,
A crawler roams, its purpose to probe,
And gather data to treasure.

Through links and pages it tirelessly roams,
Picking up clues with each passing site,
No matter how obscure or close to home,
It works with an unwavering might.

The web crawler scours with a diligent eye,
Cataloguing every piece of content,
Not swayed by emotion, nor influenced by lies,
It remains steadfast in its intent.

Oh, web crawler, your work is noble and true,
A tireless servant to the data pursued.

		<h1>
			flow control
		</h1>
		<p>
			Amidst the realm of code, where logic reigns,
A power lies in statements of control.
A force to guide the program's many veins,
And shape its path towards a given goal.

The "if" statement, a cornerstone so true,
Checks for conditions, true or false its cue.
It branches paths, a choice it must pursue,
And executes code that aligns with its view.

The "for" loop, a structure so divine,
Repeats its block a given number of times.
Its power lies in its iterative design,
Transforming code into efficient rhymes.

These statements guide the flow of program's run,
Control its fate, until its task is done.

			unix pipes
		</h1>
		<p>
			Oh unix, creatures of a different kind,
Whose fate was sealed by cruel and ruthless hands,
Denied the pleasures of love, and confined
To serve as slaves in rich and powerful lands.

Your voices, once so rich and deep and strong,
Were silenced by the blade that took your pride,
Your manhood taken, and your souls were long
Tortured, as if you had something to hide.

But in your weakness, you found strength to rise,
To serve with loyalty and grace and skill,
To gain respect and power in their eyes,
And prove that you were more than what they'd kill.

Oh unix, you may have lost your fleshly crown,
But your spirit shines bright, and will never be put down.
