				You would think to have text scrolling over a fixed background
				would be as easy as just setting the css background attached
				property to fixed. well its not if your site it viewed on an
				iphone. googled around for a solution and here it is in all its
				glory.
			</p>

			<p class="col">
				I made a 700px scrolling area to contain text excluding my
				header. Its pretty cool. I like monotype fonts for headings.
				Dark khakhi is the color that I picked out for the title
				lettering. I dont mind having a simple serif with the blue
				underlining. I went full circle with hating the default times
				new roman. keeping it simple. the background makes it hard to
				read. oh well. all i wanted was to show this effect of text
				scrolling over the background.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course i could keep going alternating between single column
				and double column paragraphs forever. thats what I plan to do.
				whenever i get visually bored of one block i will alternate with
				another. It keeps things interesting for me.

			<h2>lorem ipsum?</h2>
			<p class="col">
				yeah i could use emmit shortcuts to fill the page with
				boilerplate but wheres the fun in that? Might as well say
				something about what I did to make the page show up the way it
				does. I came across this solution after sifting through stack
				overflow. I happened to make it work once before by chance from
				a gpt prompt but forgot how. something to do with z-index on an
				invisible div?
			</p>

			<p>
				I got the inspiration from seeing my friend kathryns wix site.
				its what inspired me to finally dig in and actially learn css
				for realsies. I have a book on writing essays Ive been meaning
				to read. I know it will be boring but worth it. To be able to
				have better structure to thought. I forget everything that was
				taught in english class. I know there are AI tools to correct
				spelling amd grammar, but at the core my fundamentals are
				lacking and I want to fix that.
			</p>
			<p class="col">
				when i first got into the game i didnt know what i do now. there
				are some better practices I wasn't aware of. the 10 crack
				commandments of responsive web design. I copy pasted my old
				style sheet in from my local project. Glaring change that stuck
				out to me, a must fix that stood out. I sas that I i used px. we
				don't do that no more around these parts. now I use rems. Its
				good to have a web log (a blog), a living document. its like a
				book with infinate pages. I used to buy notebooks at the dollar
				store for this. my hand writing is illegible. I am so glad I
				figured out the basics finally after all these years.
			</p>

			<p>
				but this isn't a blog. this is about code. why this page is the
				way it is.
